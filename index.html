    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is by far, the most widely used version control system in the world today. Originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (also famous for creating the original Linux kernal). We use git to track changes that have been made to our code, and allow multiple people to work a project at the same time, without overwriting each other's changes.</p>
    
    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>

    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files that you are currently working on. You can think of a working tree as a file system where you can view and modify files. The index, or staging area, is where commits are prepared. The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.</p>
    
    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>The staging area is like a rough draft space, it's where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project).</p>
    
    <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    <p>Git pull remotename branchname</p>
